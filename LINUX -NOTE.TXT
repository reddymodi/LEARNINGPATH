Linux is an operating system like windows,MacOs.
Linux was developed by Linus Thorvalds in 1991, actually it was not his idea to develop an another OS,it was for an updated version of Unix but not accepted by Unix board members.

Structure of Linux.

software applications,user processes,user utility,compilers

 KERNAL MODULES
       |
       |
HARDWARE[CPU,RAM,I/O DEVICES]



KERNAL:
       Kernal is the core part of the operating system,it establishes connection between  devices and software,and it also manages system resources

It has four main responsibilities
1.Device management:
  kernals store all the info about devices connected to the system in device drivers.thIs kernal knows which device can do what but 
  kernal has a set of rules to be followed by the devices.

2.Memory management:
 Kernal keeps tarck of used and unused memory and makes sure that processes should not manapulate data of each other using virtual memory addresses

3.Process management:
in this process management kernal assign enough time and priority  to processes before giving another process to CPU and it also deals with security.

4.Handling system calls:
means programmers or developers can write a query or ask kernal to perform a task.


System Libraries:

 System libraries are used in accessing kernal features..Kernal has to be triggered to perform a task and this trigggering is done by  
 applications but these applications m,ust know how to place a system call because each kernal has different set of system calls.

 so developers has developed a standard library of procedures that supports each OS,
 the mainly used system library is GNU-C LIBRARY(GLIBC)


SYSTEM TOOLS:

Linux supports a set of system tools which are simple commands, with these commands we can access files,manipulate data in directories or files and anything..

development tools:
 with kernal, system libraries and system tools our OS is running and working but to update your system we need additional tools and libraries and these tools and libraries are written by programmers and are called toolchain.
a toolchain is a vital development tool used by developers to produce a working application.

END USER TOOLS:

these tools make a system unique for a user..end tools are not required for OS and these are for end users only..

why linux:

1.Open source and free
2.secure
3.so many distribution available like centos,ubuntu,red-hat
4.fast
5.less no of malware attacks
6.widely used by developers from super computers to small electronic gadgets.


How linux works?

 Every Linux-based operating system has the Linux kernel and set of software packages to manage hardware resources.

Also, Linux OS includes some core GNU tools to provide a way to manage the kernel resources, install software, configure the security setting and performance, and many more. All these tools are packaged together to make a functional operating system.

Linux features:
multiuser capability: Multi user can acess the system resources at the same time
multitasking: mre than one function can be performed simultaneously 
secure: provides security in 3 ways..1.authenticating,2.authorization,3.encryptin
open source: its surce code is freely available
portability:it supports all types of hardwares
live cd/usb: we can run all linux distros without even installing 
applications support

LINUX BASH:
bash is commond language intrupter as well as programing language it,s supports varibles and  functions
and flow control.it can also read and excute the commands from a file.which is called a shell script.

SHELL:
the terminal contains a shell,it's allow excute to commands and to intract with sysytems.we can perform a various 
operations such as store and retrive data,proccess information and  various simpe as well as complex tasks.
like basic operations:Date,cal,pwd,ls..

SCRIPTING:
Linux supports feature called scripting that allow us to excute more than one task at once
so its good define a script rather than perfoming repetative tasks.lets define script its combination of tasks.
createa file with .sh extension.
ex :file is = vi task.sh after click "esc" butoon and after click"i" to insert mode.then write a script afte click"escp" button 
    and ":wq!" to write code to exit the script
--- "chmod" command used to give the read and write permisiion to file
    ex: chmod +x task.sh
--- "./" is used excute a script file
    ex: ./task.sh

Linux Set Environment vairble:
the envronment varibles are dynamic that are stored in with in system and launched by shell or sub shell.the environment varibles
custmize the system perfomance and behaviour of an application.
-- "export" commonds set a new envoronment varible
    ex: export kesava=500
--- "echo" commond used to display the envromnent varible
    ex: echo kesava
---- "echo $kesav" is used to display the env varible value
     ex:echo $kesava
----"env" command used to display the all avilable environment varible
----"unset" commond is used to remove the environment varible
     ex:unset kesava
LINUX SET:
  linux "set" commond is used to set and unset certain flags are setting within the shell environment.
---- "set -x" is show the commonds and their arguments and turn on the debugging
----"set +x" is used to turn off the debugging
----"set -c" to disble the defaut behaviour of bash
----set -e" to stop a script immidiatly
----"export" the export commond is used to without any arguments , will display the all environment varibles
---- "export -p" is commond is used to display the current shell
----"export -f" to use a function with the export commond "-f".if we does not use a option its consider as a varible.
----"printenv" used to print the varibels.

Linux directory commonds:
 pwd -- show the present directory
 ls  -- used to show the list of folders
 cd  -- its used to change the directory
 mkdir -- create your own directory
 rmir -- used to remove the directory
root directoy --- the rootdirectory is the top most directry of the system
                  . its denaid by "/"
                  .the admin create a user
home directory -- the home directory is the sub dirctory of root directry
                  . its denaid by "user/usename"
                  . the user have a home directory

      ex:cat demo.txt | tac | cat | tac
-----"cut" commond is used to display the specific column in file. ex: cut -d- -f2 marks.txt
-----"gep"it is a most powerful and useful filter in linux .it's useful for searching the content from the file with in use pipe.
     ex: cat marks.txt | grep 9
-----"comm" commond used to comparee two fies or streams. its display the three columns, first colum in non-matching items form first file and 
      second column in non-matching items from second file and third column in matching file from both files.

-----"host" host commond is usd to display the ip address from the given domain name and vice versa. EX: host javapoint.com 

LINUX USERS COMMONDS:
  this tutorila tells how to identify the system users and how to create second account and run the programs 
  in use "su" and "sudo" commonds.
-----"whoami" it's tells about users username.
-----"who" gives inforamtion about the users logged on the sysytem.
-----"who am i" display the information aout current user only.
-----"w" this commond tells about the users who are logged in and what are doing.
-----"id" this commond tells aboud your user id,group id and list of groups belongs to
LINUX CREATE A USER:
  linux is multi-usersystem , which means more than one user can work can work at the same system and 
  same time.there are two most ways add a users in linux server.
  1.GUI(graphical through user manager)
  2.by useradd commond
GUI:
linux gui allow us to create a user from a function.its a stright forword proccess.
step1:goto system search and serach for settings and after navigate to detiails->about.
step2:click on the user and after unlock option given in the header. it will ask
      for the system security pasword and enter the pasword and click ok.
step3:click on the Add user optin and add the new user.
step4:enter the user details like user name and passwors and account type.we can ccreate a two types of
      account thre are standard and asministrator.the standard account does not conatin sudo preveligence.
step5:now we have suuessfully create a new user

BY THE LINUX USERADD COMMOND:
----"useradd" is commond-line utility which is add or remove a user in linux server its unix based syetm.
     ex: sudo useradd jtp3
         sudo passwd jtp3
----some times a newly created user may or may not assign to home directory. to create a user forcefully
    to assign homedirectory.
    EX: sudo useradd -m dmeo
----use "-d" option to create a user in diffrent home directory.
    ex:sudo useradd -m -d /demo2 demo
-----"-e" create a user with an expire date thats means particular date, its automatically deleted
      EX: sudo useradd -d /home/test -e 2023-01-22 Demo
LINUX SU COMMONDS:
-----"su" commond is used to run a shell as another user. Ex: su jpt3
-----when you change the su to root you know the root password EX: su root
-----the root user becoming any existing user without knowing the users password.otheriwse password is needed
     Ex:su -ssit
----- by default su commond maintain the same shell, to access the target shell env su commond followed with
      (-) target user name
       Ex: su - jtp3 or su jtp
-----"su -" if you not assign any username ,its default assign the rooot user name.
----- the "sudo" commond is allows to user start with program credentials in another user.
      EX: sudo /usr/sbin/useradd -m akki
-----to perform root like a task , a user given all sudo rights to etc/sudoers.
     ex:grep admin etc/sudoers
LINUX USER MANAGEMENT:
----the local user database in linux is etc/passwd directory.EX: tail etc/passwd.
----"useradd -D "used to display the files
----"userdel" it used to delete a acount user.
----"usermod' commond is used to modify the properties of user ex: usermod -c "Modi" modi
----"/etc/skel" its contains some hidden files . while using "usermod -m" opiton, the /etc/skel/ is copied to newly created directory
----"userdel -r" its deleted user and along with user acount
----"/etc/passwd" tells login  shell for the present user. EX:tail -2 /etc/paswd
----"usermod -s" you can change the shell mode in use usermod commond Ex:usermod -s /bin/bash/Modi
----"chsh' and "chsh -s" it used to change the login shell.Ex:chsh /bin/sh or chsh -s /bin/sh
LINUX PASWORD COMMONDS:
----"passwd" change the password for current users are directorys.EX:passwd or passwd Modi
----"/etc/shadow" shadow files are encrypted user passwords.this can be read only directory and read only root.
----"openssl passwd" it can be generate a several distinct hashes for the same password.to do this its use salt.
     Ex:openssl passwd hunter2
----"salt" is visible the first two charecters of hashes.EX:openssl passwd -salt Modi
----To create a user with paswword using openssl commond
    EX:useradd -m -p$(openssl paeewd hunter2) kesav.
----"/etc/login.dfs" it contain some default settings ike password aging and length setting.
    Ex:grep PASS /etc/logins.dfs
----"change" commond is used to know the about the password information.the "-l" option is used to list the information
    EX:change -l Modi
----the features can be used to disable the paswword is callaed locking ,disbleing and suspendimg a user account.
    it can be done by vi mod and usermod.
    Ex:usermod -L Modi.
----every linux distrubution have too manage groups . goups can be managed by graphcal tools and commond line tools
----"groupadd" commond is used to add the group.
----"etc/group" tells itsa group membership.a user can be morethan on group.
----"group" commond is used to user commond belongs to.
----the group member is edit with "usermod" are "useradd" commonds.and "-a" useed to append auser to group.
----"groupmod" commond is used to change the group name in existing group.Ex:groupmod -n groupname.
----"gpasswd" control of group membership passed on another user.ex:gpasswd -A user group
---primary group:when we create afile in user account,by default filegroup set to primary group.its stores the users information.
---secondry group:to specific permissions to limited users.
To create a user:  sudo useradd name
to create a group: sudo groupadd name

to add a user to a particular group: "sudo usermod -a -G groupname username"
to add a suer to multiple groups: "sudo usermod -a -G primarygrpname, groupname1, grpname2 username"
to list all the groups in system: "getent groups"
to del a user from group: "sudo gpasswd -d usrname grpname"
to change the users primayr group:"sudo usermod -g groupname username"

-G is to change secondary group
-g is to change primary group
----linux everything like a file.if it is not file its porccess.a file doesnt nlude only files,images and audio files and more.

file systems:
--- a linux filesystem is a collections of files or disk drive partitions.

ext,ext2,ext3,ext4  are extended file systems which were used in uinix os, these are no longer used, these are old versions
among all these extended file systems ext4 is faster and it is the default file system in linux distributions

JFS FILE SYSTEM:
Journaled file system, it is developed by IBM for AIX unix.it can be used in place of ext4, it is a handy file system when CPU power is limited.

ReiserFS file system:  it is an alternative file system for ext3, it has so many drawbacks

XFS file system:  it is cosidered as the high speed jornled file system which is developed for parallel I/O proccessing. NASA is still using this file system with its high storage server 300+ terabyte server.

Btrfs--B tree file system, it is used for fault tolerance ,repair system, extensive storage configuration,it is not good for production system

---linux display the files in vairous ways like "cat,less,nl,more,gnome-open,kde-openxdg-open,head,tail,open".
---linux files editsso many ways like"vi, cat >, echo > ,>,nano,emacs"
---linux "strings" commond is used to return a string character into files.
---however we can change the limit in forcefullly used to "-n" commond.ex:stringd -n number text.txt
---piping the limit to use pip symbol ex:strings filename | less
---to print the new charactre and lines in used to "-w" commond in files.ex:strings -w filename
---"vi stringout" commond us used create string fileand excute commmond is "strings @stringout filename".

PRINT:
---linux "print" commond used to print afile or output.
---ip or ipr used to print a terminal.
---ipg used to dispaly the queued print jobs.
---

Ip file_name  -- to print a file

"Ipstat -p -d"  : to list all the printers connected."-p" is uded to display the list of printers."-d" is specifies the default printer

"Ip -d printer_name  file_name"
"Ipr -P printer_name  file_name"  : to print file from particular printer

"Ipoptions -d printer_name"  : to set the default printer

"Ip -n number_of_copies file_name":  to print multiple copies
"Ipr _#number file_name"

'cancel job-id" : to cancel the queued job and "iprm jon-id"

to see job-id use "Ipq or Ipstat" commands

to move to queued print job to another printer :  "Ipmove job-id printer_name"

to print two sides of the page:  Ip -o sides=two-sided-short-edge file_name
                                 Ip -o sides=two-sided-long-edge file_name

--
Processes::

many programs may  take place in RAM or in CPU by OS or by users, these programms are called as Processes.

Process will be terminated on its own when completed or when we kill it
 some processes will hang up due to errors or due to consuming high CPU% etc,we need to kill those processes else our system will hang up

to kill a process we need to know the process information like Process id(PID),signal and more
---"top" to know all the running processes with PID, name,cpu% etc
---"ps aux" -- to know all the running processes.. 
    a- to display processes running by all users
    u-   to display processes running by particular user
    x- to display processes running by GUI
---suppose we want filter the user in ps used commond is "ps aux | grep username".
---"pidof" is used to locate the pid of procccess.ex:pidof proccessname.
---"killall" commond is used to killl the proccess and quit the proccess. EX:killall proccessname.
---to forcefull ykill the process excute the 'kilall' commond with "-SIGKILL".EX:killall -SIGKILL proccessname.
---to kill aproccess intractivlt "-i".ex:killall -i proccessname.
---ot kill a proccess diffrent user.EX:"killall -i processname.
---we can also killa process in fixed time period used to "-y" or "-o" flags.EX:killall -y 20m proccessname.
---"pkill" is used to kill the matching processnames.EX:pkill fire.
---"kill -l" is show the list of signals.
---"xlsclients" to get a list of x clients.
---"nohup" this commond is overcome the problems and ignores the all hangup signals and allows the proccess to continue.ex:nohup cat string.sh after "nohup.out'
----to satrt a proccess in background used to "&" symbol.it will excute the proces in background EX:ping w3cshool.com &.
----"at" commond is used to schdule a task to excute a once it at specified time,without editing configuration time.
----"atq" commond is used to display the all users pending tasks.
----"atrm" is used todisplay the delete tasks and identify their jobs.
----"atq" isused to list the schduked tasks.ex: atq 
----"atrm" is used to remove the schduele in folloeing job id.EX:atrm -jobid.
----"-c" check the conten of scheduled task.EX:at -c jobid
----"exit" is used to exit the terminal.
FHS(filesystem hierrarchy standard):
  FHS desciribes directorys structures and it content in unix and unix is a operaitng system.its explain where files and directorys should be located 
  what should contain.
---"BINARY DIRECTORY"= the binary files contain compiled source code.
    binary directory contains sub directres like---"/bin","lib","sbin","opt".
    ex: ls /bin ,ls /sbin, ls /lib, ls /opt
---CONFIGURATION DIRECTORY: its contain configured files which configures the parameters and intial settings and some computer progrmas.
                             its folloe ssub directorys like"/boot" "/etc". EX:ls /boot, ls /etc.
---DATA DIRECTORY is used to store the data of the system.its following directories like"/home,/root,/srv,/media,/mnr,/tmp".
       Ex: ls /home, ls /root, ls /srv....
---MEMORY DIRECTORY  contain the files of the whole sysyem.al the devcie information and procceing running data and system
   related information stored in this directory.this directory folowing directories like "/dec, /proc, /sys".
   Ex:ls /dec, ls /proc, ls /sys.
   in "proc" and "sys" it show the kernal view.
----USR(UNIX SYSTEM RESOURCES):it is also called secondry hirearchy it contains binarys,libraries,
